## **Architecture Decisions**

* **Next.js App Router**: Built with the App Directory for modern routing and server components.
* **Local JSON File (Development Only)**: Uses `db.json` with the Node.js `fs` module to simulate a backend during development.
  **Note**: This is not suitable for production as serverless environments don’t support file system writes.
* **Component-Driven UI**: Includes modular components like `DocumentGrid`, `FilterSidebar`, `CreateDocumentModal`, etc.
* **Vercel Deployment**: The project is optimized for seamless deployment on Vercel.
